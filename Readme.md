# foROSt

Access to BehaviorTree.CPP via ROS2 interfaces.

This is intended for Python ROS2 users, as it is already possible to use ROS functionalities in custom BT-Node classes.

## Requirements

Install BehaviorTree.CPP as described here:
https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP

You may need to edit your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Get `forost_interfaces` which includes the ROS2 message types used in this package.
